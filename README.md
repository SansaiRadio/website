# Ferret Radio's new website
The aim of this new update was to keep things as simple and easy as possible. One thing I absolutely focused on was keeping everything on one page, so that the user could continue listening without having to switch pages.

Previously, the website was hastily thrown together. This time, I aimed to create a sleek and responsive design which could be easily understood straight away.
One example of this would be the player. In the old website, the player was simply an embedded .m3u link and was left to take on the appearance of whatever browser's default player was being used. This time, I created separate working buttons to design our own player.
